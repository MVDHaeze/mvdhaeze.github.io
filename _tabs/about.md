> Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So, throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in you sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. **H. Jackson Brown Jr.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In april 2020 when the whole world was in lockdown, wondering what the future will be, I quit my job. It was neither a _YOLO move_ nor a fully planned decision. On the contrary, I was supposed to move abroad for a new job but like many people, my plans went haywire when the pandemic hit. Seeing this change of plan as an opportunity and thanks to personal circumstances, I chose to take a break from the professional world for a few weeks.

A few weeks became a few months, then one year and now, I am close to reach the 2 years mark. That is a lot of free time so what did I use it for? Well, I am genuinely curious so I did what feels natural to me: I mostly learned new stuffs. Some of things learned have a more or less professional value[^ftnt-1], other are purely personal but all of them shaped the person I am now.

- Dive myself into non-fiction books (311 in February 2022 and counting), doing over my education in social sciences to better understand the world around me
- Took my design understanding (mainly in UI and UX) a step further, by spending more time creating on Illustrator and hardening my theoretical knowledge through books
- Learned from scratch web development (MERN stack) that I still use for personal projects and made me better apprehend what is happening under the hood
- Continued to improve my data-related skills in Python by working on side projects (from purely data science to proper information design in dashboards)
- Hardened my overall computer science understanding following "[Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)" (as you may have understood, I tend to be a self-taught man ^^ )

On a lighter touch, I also:

- Rediscovered music by starting to drum, a decade after I last played bass guitar with friends (currently mastering _Stick Control for the Snare Drummer_)
- Doing again some electronics projects on a protoboard despite hating it during university
- Thanks to my physiology and nutrition knowledge, I started coaching people to get back in shape and have a better alimentation in general

[^ftnt-1]: Some criticisms could be said regarding the uselessness of learning things in superficial ways and/or not becoming a professional expert. I tend to think the opposite, it is good to have core competencies but exploring unrelated topics expand your open-mindedness and allow you to think through an interdisciplinary lens.
